# LOL_Chat_report

If chatting log is putted the result is printed as a list form like

['Garen', ':', '-4', 'Leesin', ':', '-3', 'Karma', ':', '0', 'Apelios', ':', '0', 'Yumi', ':', '0']

Here, I have set the two people with the highest deduction points as the report target,

but you guys can change the criteria anytime you want.
